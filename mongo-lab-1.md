# Starting with Mongo

## Preparation

Create a new readme file called `mongo-lab-commands.md` in the repo and copy/paste the commands that are used to complete each step below.

You will be writing your answers in a Markdown document and your answers must be formatted properly, so it would be worthwhile to review the [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

## Instructions

A. Use the command line to create a classroom database. Insert entries for yourself and the people your cohort in a students collection. Each document should have:

1. A field of name with the person's name.
2. A field of list of favorite food
3. A field of age
3. A field of os which will contain the Operating System of the computer they are using: 'Mac', 'Win', etc
4. A field of hobbies with an array of the hobbies the person likes to do.

B. Use find commands to get:

1. A list of everyone in your class.
2. An entry for a single person.

C. Create a collection name instructors

1. Create a single document that can hold the following instructors Joe, Alex, Kenneth, Nathaniel and Aegean; field name should be instructor_list
2. Remove Nathaniel from the instructors list

### BONUS

If you finish early, check out the [MongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/) and figure out how to find users by an entry in an array.
